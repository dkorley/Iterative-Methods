# Iterative-Methods
This functions solve system of linear equations Ax=b by using the iterative schemes; Jacobi method, Gauss Seidel and Jacobi over relaxation (JOR) and Successive over relaxation (SOR) by introducing a parameter w. This gives us the chance to control the spectral radius of the iterative scheme. It also checks for convergence of the scheme
